# LNS-twilio
Pure Python based Library notification system using twilio, the xls data sheet is used to store all the data.  the program automatically sends a notification to the book borrower before due date.


This is my first repository.
It is a Library Notification System purely developed using pure python. 
Different libraries like tkinter, pandas, and schedule are used.

Any suggestion or advise are accepted. Feel free to report issues and requests. :)
